## Why Reactive Programming

### Asynchronous

- Independent I/O operations run concurrently
- But code becomes a mess of nested callbacks

Creating large asynchronous applications are not the easiest thing to do.
Can we do better? Can we combine the simplicity of synchronous code with efficiency of asynchronous code.
Yes.

#### Observables

Observables are an abstraction that allows us to express the effect of latency in asynchronous computation and encapsulate event handling code and user higher order functions such as map reduce and filter

- Express effect of latency
- Encapsulate Event handling
- Use higher order functions like map, reduce and so on
